# Horiseon-Website README

The original HTML and CSS for Horiseon's website was functional, but did not take accessibility and SEO into consideration. Additionally, the code was redundant and needed to be simplified. Here, I refactored the webpage to include semantic elements for better accessibility and I compressed the CSS into less lines of code, leaving comments throughout to indicate where changes occurred.
